                <li>We admitted that we were powerless over lust—that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
                <li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
                <li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God <span class="italic">as we understood Him.</span></li>
                <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
                <li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
                <li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
                <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
                <li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
                <li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
                <li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
                <li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
                <li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to sexaholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</li>

                <li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends on SA unity.</li>
                <li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
                <li>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop lusting and become sexually sober.</li>
                <li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or Sexaholics Anonymous as a whole.</li>
                <li>Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the sexaholic who still suffers.</li>
                <li>An SA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the SA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</li>
                <li>Every SA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</li>
                <li>Sexaholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers.</li>
                <li>SA, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</li>
                <li>Sexaholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the SA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li>
                <li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, films, and television.</li>
                <li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.</li>

                <p>
                  We can only speak for ourselves. The specialized nature of Sexaholics Anonymous can best be understood in terms of what we call the sexaholic. The sexaholic has taken himself or herself out of the whole context of what is right or wrong. He or she has lost control, no longer has the power of choice, and is not free to stop. Lust has become an addiction.Our situation is like that
                  of the alcoholic who can no longer tolerate alcohol and must stop drinking altogether but is hooked and cannot stop. So it is with the sexaholic, or sex drunk, who can no longer tolerate lust but cannot stop.
                </p>

              <div class="space-y-2">
                <p>
                  Thus, for the sexaholic, any form of sex with one's self or with partners other than the spouse is progressively addictive and destructive. We also see that lust is the driving force behind our sexual acting out, and true sobriety includes progressive victory over lust. These conclusions were forced upon us in the crucible of our experiences and recovery; we have no other
                  options. But we have found that acceptance of these facts is the key to a happy and joyous freedom we could otherwise never know.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This will and should discourage many inquirers who admit to sexual obsession or compulsion but who simply want to control and enjoy it, much as the alcoholic would like to control and enjoy drinking. Until we had been driven to the point of despair, until we really wanted to stop but could not, we did not give ourselves to this program of recovery. Sexaholics Anonymous is for
                  those who know they have no other option but to stop, and their own enlightened self-interest must tell them this.

            Have you ever thought you needed help for your sexual thinking or behavior? That you'd be better off if you didn't keep “giving in”? That sex or stimuli are controlling you? Have you ever tried to stop or limit doing what you felt was wrong in your sexual behavior? Do you resort to sex to escape, relieve anxiety, or because you can't cope? Do you feel guilt, remorse or depression
            afterward? Increase acceptance of non-traditional sexual relationships and the continuous increase in availability of online sex and sexual material has contributed to
