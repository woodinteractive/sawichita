								Sexaholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share

								membership; we are self-supporting through our own
								contributions. SA is not allied with any sect, denomination,
								politics, organization, or institution; does not wish to engage
								in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our
								primary purpose is to stay sexually sober and help others to
								achieve sexual sobriety.<sup>*</sup>

								<p>
									We can only speak for ourselves. The specialized nature of
									Sexaholics Anonymous can best be understood in terms of what
									we call the sexaholic. The sexaholic has taken himself or
									herself out of the whole context of what is right or wrong. He
									or she has lost control, no longer has the power of choice,
									and is not free to stop. Lust has become an addiction.Our
									situation is like that of the alcoholic who can no longer
									tolerate alcohol and must stop drinking altogether but is
									hooked and cannot stop. So it is with the sexaholic, or sex
									drunk, who can no longer tolerate lust but cannot stop.

							<div class="space-y-2">
								<p>
									Thus, for the sexaholic, any form of sex with one's self or
									with partners other than the spouse is progressively addictive
									and destructive. We also see that lust is the driving force
									behind our sexual acting out, and true sobriety includes
									progressive victory over lust. These conclusions were forced
									upon us in the crucible of our experiences and recovery; we
									have no other options. But we have found that acceptance of
									these facts is the key to a happy and joyous freedom we could
									otherwise never know.
								</p>
								<p>
									This will and should discourage many inquirers who admit to
									sexual obsession or compulsion but who simply want to control
									and enjoy it, much as the alcoholic would like to control and
									enjoy drinking. Until we had been driven to the point of
									despair, until we really wanted to stop but could not, we did
									not give ourselves to this program of recovery. Sexaholics
									Anonymous is for those who know they have no other option but
									to stop, and their own enlightened self-interest must tell
									them this.
